1. Work through the set-up, execution, and analysis of a simple Lennard-Jones NVE
simulation using the HOOMD simulation engine.

Launch the LJ-NVT.ipynb notebook
 >> jupyter notebook
 Select LJ-NVT.ipynb

Step through the notebook paying attention to the description for each block of
code. If you are unsure of what a command does, refer to the documentation
located at the link provided at the beginning of the notebook.

2. Determine the maximum timestep we can use for this simulation. (Hint: Check for
energy conservation)

3. Optimizing neighborlist settings. When running a simulation we want to use the
neighborlist settings that yield the fastest simulation time without missing
interactions.
 3a. What is the optimal value of `r_buff` when `check_period` is 1?
 3b. What is the optimal value of `check_period` when `r_buff` is 0.4?
 3c. What are the optimal values of `r_buff` and `check_period`? Provide benchmarks
     to support your answer.

4. Increase the particle density by initializing a lattice of 250 particles. How does
this change your answers for 2 and 3?
